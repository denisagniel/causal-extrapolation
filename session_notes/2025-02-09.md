# Session note — 2025-02-09

## What was done

- Updated README (extrapolateATT workflow, build/run, demo); committed full project and added session note.
- Paper: bibliography and in-text citations in place (no "(cites)" left); fixed Section 5 typo and formalized $G_i$ as function of $A_i$; Related Work and Section 5 expanded with identification, concrete $f$, and full EIF subsection (Path 1 and Path 2, variance, optional cross-fitting); Abstract and Discussion added. Estimands defined for $\P_{p+k}$, $k \geq 1$, with focus on $k=1$ in the rest of the paper.
- Development docs and plans: paper-next-steps (Steps 1–4 done), citation-gaps outline, simulation-ideas and simulation-suite plan; repo ready for sim work.

## Key changes

- **README:** Project summary, workflow, build steps, run-all demo.
- **Paper:** Abstract and Discussion in place; Section 5.1 semiparametric EIF and optional cross-fitting; general-horizon estimands ($\P_{p+k}$, FATT/FATU at $k$) then $k=1$ for identification/estimation.
- **Repo:** package/, sims/, latex/, development-docs/, refs/, presentations/ tracked; .gitignore includes .DS_Store.

## Decisions

- Session notes in `session_notes/` at project root; two commits (project state, then session note).
- Paper leaves simulation/application and package/sims reference for Step 5.

## Open questions

- (Add any unresolved items, e.g. which simulation sections to implement first, or whether to add optional citations from citation-gaps-and-outline.)

## Follow-ups

- **Paper:** Step 5 — add at least one simulation or applied example; optionally reference package/sims in Section 5 or an Implementation remark.
- **Sims:** Implement suite from [simulation-ideas.md](development-docs/simulation-ideas.md) (DGP helpers, Path 1 aggregator, section scripts) per the simulations-from-simulation-ideas plan.
- **Citations:** Optional: add missing bib entries (e.g. Callaway & Sant'Anna) and fill remaining gaps in [citation-gaps-and-outline.md](development-docs/citation-gaps-and-outline.md).
