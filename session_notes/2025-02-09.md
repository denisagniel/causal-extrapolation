# Session note — 2025-02-09

## What was done

- Updated README with extrapolateATT description, workflow overview, build/run instructions, and demo.
- Committed full project state: package, sims, latex paper, development-docs, refs, presentations; added .gitignore (including .DS_Store).

## Key changes

- **README:** Project summary, workflow (estimate group–time ATTs → extrapolation model → EIF propagation → optional integrate_covariates → compute_variance), build steps, run-all demo.
- **Repo:** .gitignore updated; package/, sims/, latex/, development-docs/, refs/, presentations/ now tracked.

## Decisions

- Session notes live in `session_notes/` at project root per notes-repo guidance.
- Single initial commit for project state; session note in a follow-up commit.

## Open questions

- (Add any unresolved items from the session.)

## Follow-ups

- Continue paper next steps (see `development-docs/paper-next-steps.md`).
- Expand simulations per `development-docs/simulation-ideas.md`.
- Optional: fill remaining citation gaps per `development-docs/citation-gaps-and-outline.md`.
