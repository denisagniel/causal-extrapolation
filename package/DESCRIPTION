Description: Estimate group-time average treatment effects (ATTs) with the 'did'
    package, extrapolate to future time points via user-specified temporal models
    h_g(·), propagate efficient influence functions (EIFs) by chain rule, optionally
    integrate conditional effects over a target covariate distribution, and compute
    standard errors and confidence intervals. The semiparametric theory and EIF
    propagation (Section 5.1) are described in the accompanying paper in
    latex/Estimating_policy_effects_in_the_presence_of_heterogeneity.
