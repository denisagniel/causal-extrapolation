Instead of using panel data to adjust for differences in the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity between the treated and comparison groups, we instead use panel data to search for "close comparison groups" -- groups that are similar to the treated group in terms of pre-treatment outcomes. Then, we compare the outcomes of the treated group to the outcomes of these close comparison groups in post-treatment periods. We show that this approach is often identification-strategy-robust in the sense that our approach recovers the ATT under many different non-nested panel data identification strategies, including difference-in-differences, change-in-changes, or lagged outcome unconfoundedness, among several others. We provide related, though non-nested, results under "time homogeneity", where outcomes do not systematically change over time for any comparison group. Our strategy asks more out of the research design -- namely that there exist close comparison groups or time homogeneity (neither of which is required for most existing panel data approaches to causal inference) -- but, when available, leads to more credible inferences.},

Evaluating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) of social policies is critical to determine how social policies will affect health inequities. Methods for evaluating HTEs are not standardized. Little is known about how often and by what methods HTEs are assessed in social policy and health research. Methods: A sample of 55 articles from 2019 on the health effects of social policies were evaluated for frequency of reporting HTEs; for what subgroupings HTEs were reported; frequency of a priori specification of intent to assess HTEs; and methods used for assessing HTEs. Results: A total of 24 (44\%) studies described some form of HTE assessment, including by age, gender, education, race/ethnicity, and/or geography. Among studies assessing HTEs, 63\% specified HTE assessment a priori, and most (71\%) used descriptive methods such as stratification; 21\% used statistical tests (e.g., interaction terms in a regression); and no studies used data-driven algorithms. Conclusions: Although understanding HTEs could enhance policy and practice-based efforts to reduce inequities, it is not routine research practice. Increased evaluation of HTEs across relevant subgroups is needed.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in causal inference allow us to transport a causal effect of a time-fixed treatment from a randomized trial to a target population across space but within the same time frame. In contrast to transportability across space, transporting causal effects across time or forecasting causal effects of future interventions is more challenging due to time-varying confounders and time-varying effect modifiers. In this article, we seek to formally clarify the causal estimands for forecasting causal effects over time and the structural assumptions required to identify these estimands. Specifically, we develop a set of novel nonparametric identification formulas--g-computation formulas--for these causal estimands, and lay out the conditions required to accurately forecast causal effects from a past observed sample to a future population in a future time window. Our overarching objective is to leverage the modern causal inference theory to provide a theoretical framework for investigating whether the effects seen in a past sample would carry over to a new future population. Throughout the article, a working example addressing the effect of public policies or social events on COVID-related deaths is considered to contextualize the developments of analytical results.},

  abstract = {Background Some patients will experience more or less benefit from treatment than the averages reported from clinical trials; such variation in therapeutic outcome is termed heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE). Identifying HTE is necessary to individualize treatment. The degree to which heterogeneity is sought and analyzed correctly in the general medical literature is unknown. We undertook this literature sample to track the use of HTE analyses over time, examine the appropriateness of the statistical methods used, and explore the predictors of such analyses. Methods Articles were selected through a probability sample of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, and NEJM during odd numbered months of 1994, 1999, and 2004. RCTs were independently reviewed and coded by two abstractors, with adjudication by a third. Studies were classified as reporting: (1) HTE analysis, utilizing a formal test for heterogeneity or treatment-by-covariate interaction, (2) subgroup analysis only, involving no formal test for heterogeneity or interaction; or (3) neither. Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression were used to identify variables associated with HTE reporting. Results 319 studies were included. Ninety-two (29\%) reported HTE analysis; another 88 (28\%) reported subgroup analysis only, without examining HTE formally. Major covariates examined included individual risk factors associated with prognosis, responsiveness to treatment, or vulnerability to adverse effects of treatment (56\%); gender (30\%); age (29\%); study site or center (29\%); and race/ethnicity (7\%). Journal of publication and sample size were significant independent predictors of HTE analysis (p {$<$} 0.05 and p {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Conclusion HTE is frequently ignored or incorrectly analyzed. An iterative process of exploratory analysis followed by confirmatory HTE analysis will generate the data needed to facilitate an individualized approach to evidence-based medicine.},

Drawing on experimental evidence of policy effectiveness, analysts aim to predict the effects~of policies in new populations, which might differ importantly from experimental populations. Existing approaches made progress in articulating the sorts of similarities one needs to assume to enable such inferences. It is also recognized, however, that many of these assumptions will remain surrounded by significant uncertainty in practice. Unfortunately, the existing literature says little on how analysts may articulate and manage these uncertainties. This paper aims to make progress on these issues. First, it considers several existing ideas that bear on issues of uncertainty, elaborates the challenges they face, and extracts some useful rationales. Second, it outlines a novel approach, called the support graph approach, that builds on these rationales and allows analysts to articulate and manage uncertainty in extrapolation in a systematic and unified way.},

  abstract = {Transporting causal information across populations is a critical challenge in clinical decision-making. Causal modeling provides criteria for identifiability and transportability, but these require knowledge of the causal graph, which rarely holds in practice. We propose a Bayesian method that combines observational data from the target domain with experimental data from a different domain to identify s-admissible backdoor sets, which enable unbiased estimation of causal effects across populations, without requiring the causal graph. We prove that if such a set exists, we can always find one within the Markov boundary of the outcome, narrowing the search space, and we establish asymptotic convergence guarantees for our method. We develop a greedy algorithm that reframes transportability as a feature selection problem, selecting conditioning sets that maximize the marginal likelihood of experimental data given observational data. In simulated and semi-synthetic data, our method correctly identifies transportability bias, improves causal effect estimation, and performs favorably against alternatives.},

  abstract = {Predicting the effects of a new policy often relies on existing evidence of the same policy in other contexts. Such cross-context extrapolation yields accurate predictions if local factors are orthogonal to the policy effects. When the policy effects are heterogeneous in local factors, however, one can alternatively make predictions using adjacent policies within the same context, thereby holding local factors constant. I examine this trade-off between extrapolation across contexts and policies, using cash transfer programs in Malawi and Morocco. By predicting the treatment effect of Moroccan CCTs on school enrollment rates with either Malawian CCTs or Moroccan labeled cash transfers (LCTs), I show that predictions based on the Moroccan LCTs are more accurate than the Malawian CCTs. Through the lens of my structural model, I find that perceived returns to schooling relative to outside options explain the prediction differences. My model also suggests that differences in the underlying mechanisms between the Malawian and Moroccan CCTs are reflected in the cross-contexts variation of the relative returns.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Many causal processes have spatial and temporal dimensions. Yet the classic causal inference framework is not directly applicable when the treatment and outcome variables are generated by spatio-temporal point processes. We extend the potential outcomes framework to these settings by formulating the treatment point process as a stochastic intervention. Our causal estimands include the expected number of outcome events in a specified area under a particular stochastic treatment assignment strategy. Our methodology allows for arbitrary patterns of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. Using martingale theory, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal as the number of time periods increases. We propose a sensitivity analysis for the possible existence of unmeasured confounders, and extend it to the H\'ajek estimator. Simulation studies are conducted to examine the estimators' finite sample performance. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods by estimating the effects of American airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq from February 2007 to July 2008. Our analysis suggests that increasing the average number of daily airstrikes for up to 1 month may result in more insurgent attacks. We also find some evidence that airstrikes can displace attacks from Baghdad to new locations up to 400 km away.},

  abstract = {Determining whether vaccine efficacy wanes is important for individual and public decision making. Yet, quantification of waning is a subtle task. The classical approaches cannot be interpreted as measures of declining efficacy unless we impose unreasonable assumptions. Recently, formal causal estimands designed to quantify vaccine waning have been proposed. These estimands can be bounded under weaker assumptions, but the bounds are often too wide to make claims about the presence of vaccine waning. We propose an alternative approach: a formal test to determine whether a treatment effect is constant over time. This test not only gives a considerable power gain compared to existing approaches but is also valid under plausible assumptions that are expected to hold in vaccine trials. We illustrate the increase in power through real and simulated examples, using three different approaches to compute the test statistics. Two of these approaches are based solely on summary data, accessible from existing clinical trials. Beyond our test, we also give new results that bound the waning effect. We use our methods to reanalyze data from a randomized controlled trial of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. While prior analysis did not establish waning, our test rejects the null hypothesis of no waning.},

We find three different regimes, which match the three major periods of the US economy, namely the Great Inflation, the Great Moderation and the Great Recession. The initial impact on real GDP ranges between -0.2\% for the Great Inflation and Great Recession and -0.15\% for the Great Moderation. In addition, the adverse effects of EPU are more persistent during the Great Recession providing an explanation for the slow recovery. This regime dependence is unique for EPU as the macroeconomic consequences of Financial Uncertainty turn out to be rather time invariant.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Questions concerning mediated causal effects are of great interest in psychology, cognitive science, medicine, social science, public health, and many other disciplines. For instance, about 60\% of recent papers published in leading journals in social psychology contain at least one mediation test (Rucker, Preacher, Tormala, \& Petty, 2011). Standard parametric approaches to mediation analysis employ regression models, and either the ``difference method'' (Judd \& Kenny, 1981), more common in epidemiology, or the ``product method'' (Baron \& Kenny, 1986), more common in the social sciences. In this article, we first discuss a known, but perhaps often unappreciated, fact that these parametric approaches are a special case of a general counterfactual framework for reasoning about causality first described by Neyman (1923) and Rubin (1924) and linked to causal graphical models by Robins (1986) and Pearl (2006). We then show a number of advantages of this framework. First, it makes the strong assumptions underlying mediation analysis explicit. Second, it avoids a number of problems present in the product and difference methods, such as biased estimates of effects in certain cases. Finally, we show the generality of this framework by proving a novel result which allows mediation analysis to be applied to longitudinal settings with unobserved confounders.},

It first lays out the assumptions necessary for generalizations, then investigates the amount of bias reduction and average variance inflation that is likely when compared to a conventional estimator.

To deepen our understanding of these advancements in epidemiology, in this methodologic primer, we start by presenting an overview of DiD methods. We then summarize fundamental problems associated with DiD designs with heterogeneous treatment effects and provide guidance on recently proposed heterogeneity-robust DiD estimators, which are increasingly being implemented by epidemiologists. We also extend the discussion to violations of the parallel trends assumption, which has received less attention.
